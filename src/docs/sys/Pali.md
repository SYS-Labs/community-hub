### Pali Wallet 2.0

The current Pali Wallet, version one, already has more than 30,000 monthly active users. The next major release of Pali Wallet will enable users to securely manage their cryptocurrencies across both EVM and Bitcoin-core based blockchains, including Syscoin (SYS) and Syscoin Tokenized Assets, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC[20,721,1155] tokens, and will enable users to interact with Web3 decentralized applications (dApps). The design of Pali Wallet 2.0 is focused on simple UX, efficiency and speed that are compatible with one-second blocks, and privacy enforcement without data collection. Given that some crypto extensions and stores are now tracking users, we will offer a very easy way to install the extension locally without relying on application stores and their discretionary censorship.
