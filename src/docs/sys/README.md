### Intro

Long ago, it seemed like madness to some people when the Syscoin project determined that layer 1 of the blockchain stack should ideally represent a court system instead of a transaction processor - the opposite of practically every other blockchain out there. We went against the grain of many mass-marketed third-gen blockchains of that time, even some still today, with our assertion that the base layer is best suited to serve users with repudiation of state decisions, means of governance, and to guarantee censorship resistance for users’ layer 2 accounts. Having witnessed both the evolution and arguably plenty of deterioration in blockchain technology since the beginning of Bitcoin, the necessity has only become more apparent for a steady and decentralized (albeit slow) layer 1 supporting the scaffolding of a fast and convenient layer 2. The Syscoin Platform took incremental and tactful steps to achieve its optimal design for a distributed financial computer with a fractal/modular tech stack. As such, at one time Syscoin’s competitive advantage over the sea of alternative L1s was not so obvious to casual onlookers, until now.
