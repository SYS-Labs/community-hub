## Testnet Faucets

#### Rollux Tanenbaum

[Syscoin Name Service](https://sysdomains.xyz/rollux-faucet) is an easy way to get Test SYS on Rollux Tanenbaum directly.

#### Request Tanenbaum SYS in Rollux Discord

If for any reason the Rollux Tanenbaum Faucet is unavailable, head to the [Rollux Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux) and request some Rollux Test SYS there.


#### Syscoin NEVM (L1) Tanenbaum

Syscoin Foundation offers an [L1 testnet faucet](https://faucet.tanenbaum.io) for Test SYS. This is a social media authenticated faucet. You can bridge this SYS from NEVM Tanenbaum to Rollux Tanenbaum using the [Rollux Portal](https://bridge-testnet.syscoin.org).

## Mainnet Faucets

Syscoin Foundation offers an [L1 mainnet faucet](https://faucet.syscoin.org) that provides a very small amount of SYS that can cover a basic gas fee. This is a social media authenticated faucet. You can bridge this SYS from NEVM to Rollux using the [Rollux Portal](https://bridge.syscoin.org).
