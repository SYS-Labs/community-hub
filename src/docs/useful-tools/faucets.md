### The fees on Rollux are the lowest of all the EVMs out there! ðŸŽ‰ 
This means we can provide you with mainnet SYS faucets that provide enough to cover fees in a pinch. Use them to get a tiny amount of SYS, enough to cover a network fee or two.

## Rollux SYS Faucets

#### [Rollux Mainnet]((https://rollux.id/faucet?chainId=570))

#### [Rollux Tanenbaum](https://rollux.id/faucet?chainId=57000)

If for any reason the Rollux SYS faucets are unavailable, head to the [Rollux Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux) and request some SYS there. Someone will likely be willing to send you a tiny amount.

## Syscoin NEVM SYS Faucets

#### [Syscoin NEVM (L1) Mainnet](https://faucet.syscoin.org)

#### [Syscoin NEVM (L1) Tanenbaum](https://faucet.tanenbaum.io)

NOTE: The NEVM faucets use social media authentication. The options are to use X ("Twitter") or Facebook to authenticate your request. The Facebook authentication works, but X have changed their API, so you cannot use this faucet with X/Twitter. A new simpler NEVM faucet is being set up, and we will provide that as soon as it's available.

## Higher amounts of TSYS (Test SYS) for devs and projects

If you need more TSYS than our faucets provide, head to the [Syscoin Discord](https://discord.gg/syscoin) and request a bulk amount of TSYS there. Someone will help you as soon as they can.
