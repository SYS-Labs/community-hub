## Rollux SYS Faucets

#### [Rollux Mainnet]((https://rollux.id/faucet?chainId=570))

#### [Rollux Tanenbaum](https://rollux.id/faucet?chainId=57000)

If for any reason the Rollux SYS faucets are unavailable, head to the [Rollux Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux) and request some SYS there. Someone will likely be available to send you a tiny amount.

## Syscoin NEVM SYS Faucets

#### [Syscoin NEVM (L1) Mainnet](https://faucet.syscoin.org)

#### [Syscoin NEVM (L1) Tanenbaum](https://faucet.tanenbaum.io)

NOTE: The NEVM faucets use social media authentication. The options are to use X ("Twitter") or Facebook to authenticate your request. The Facebook authentication works, but X have changed their API, so you cannot use this faucet with X/Twitter. A new simpler NEVM faucet is being set up, and we will provide that as soon as it's available.

If you cannot use the NEVM faucets for any reason, head to the [Syscoin Discord](https://discord.gg/syscoin) and request some SYS there. Someone will likely be available to send you a tiny amount.
