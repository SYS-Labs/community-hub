Welcome to the Rollux developer tools!

If you are already familiar with [building on Rollux](../developers/README.md) and just need the tools to get started, you are in the right place!

## Connecting

You have the list of [networks](./networks.md) and [node providers](./providers.md) to help you connect to a Rollux node.

## Deploying

To get some SYS bridged over for deployment gas fees, use one of the available [faucets](./faucets.md) or just bridge SYS using the [Rollux Portal](https://bridge.syscoin.org/).

## Monitoring

Your app is live in production? Watch it grow using [monitoring tools](./monitoring.md). Also, [troubleshooting tools](./debugging.md) and [block explorers](./explorers.md) to help you provide excellent service to your users.
