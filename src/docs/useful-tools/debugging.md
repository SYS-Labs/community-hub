::: tip EVM Equivalence
As Rollux is EVM Equivalent, most debugging tools work out of the box with Rollux.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) lets you inspect any transaction execution on Rollux. 
You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transactions execution, as well as step into or over function calls. 

## Blockscout

[Blockscout](/docs/useful-tools/explorers/#blockscout) allows you to see events on the Rollux networks and the Syscoin NEVM L1 networks.
