Join the ecosystem that is securing Web3 with Bitcoin and scaling EVM for widespread adoption.


To start using the variety of apps across DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and more on Rollux you'll need a wallet with some SYS to cover transaction costs. 


New to crypto, no problem! It only takes 3 steps:

1.  Download a wallet

2.  Add Rollux to your wallet (optional)

3.  Fund your wallet with SYS


Keep reading for more detailed steps!

## Step 1 - Download a wallet
Your wallet is like your universal account â€” instead of creating new accounts on every website, just connect your wallet to use apps on Rollux. Wallets allow you to store digital assets like SYS and interact with apps.

There are a lot of different wallets available.

If you're new to Rollux, the recommended wallets from the community are:

[**Pali Wallet**](https://paliwallet.com) (Mobile (iOS, Android), and browser extension (Chrome, Firefox))  
[**Metamask**](https://metamask.io) (Mobile (iOS, Android), and browser extension (Chrome, Firefox))  


## Step 2 - Add the Rollux Network to your wallet
You can skip this step if you choose to [install and use Pali Wallet](connect-pali.md)! For other wallets like MetaMask, you can add the Rollux network by following this [guide](connect-metamask.md).



## Step 3 - Fund your wallet with SYS

There are three main options to get SYS into your Rollux wallet:

### Fiat on-ramp
You can get SYS on-demand with your credit/debit card, or other legacy payment methods.

-  [Buy SYS on Coinify](https://mycoinify.com/trade/?targetPage=buy&coin=SYSROLLUX). A super easy way to get SYS on Rollux fast by using your VISA, Mastercard, Apple Pay, or SEPA.

### Centralized exchange
You can buy SYS from a growing list of centralized exchanges that support the Rollux network.

-  [Bitmart](https://bitmart.com)
-  [DigiFinex](https://digifinex.com)  
-  [LBank](https://lbank.info)
-  [MEXC](https://mexc.com)  

When you withdraw your SYS from any of the above exchanges, select Rollux as the network you are withdrawing to and provide your wallet address that begins with "0x".

::: tip
For the easiest centralized exchange experience, use one of the above exchanges that let you withdraw SYS directly to Rollux.
:::

::: info
Some exchanges offer SYS but do not yet support the Rollux network. You can get SYS from those too but you will need to move it to Rollux yourself.

Examples:

[KuCoin](https://kucoin.com) only supports withdrawing SYS to **Syscoin NEVM**.  To get your KuCoin SYS onto Rollux, see section "Bridge your SYS to Rollux from Syscoin NEVM" below for instructions.

[Binance](https://binance.com) only supports withdrawing SYS to **Syscoin UTXO**. See section "Bridge your SYS to Rollux from Syscoin UTXO" below for instructions.  
  
**A full list of SYS exchanges with the networks they support is available on Syscoin's [Get SYS](https://syscoin.org/get-sys#exchanges) page.**  
:::

### Bridge your SYS to Rollux from Syscoin NEVM
Follow this [tutorial](./using-rollux-portal.md) to get started using Rollux Portal. It makes it easy to move your SYS (or other digital assets) from Syscoin NEVM to Rollux!

### Bridge your SYS to Rollux from Syscoin UTXO
Once your SYS is in Pali Wallet (browser extension, not mobile), you can use the [Syscoin Bridge](https://bridge.syscoin.org) to move your SYS to Syscoin NEVM.  Once your SYS is on NEVM, proceed to the [Rollux Portal](https://bridge.rollux.com) to move your SYS to Rollux.
