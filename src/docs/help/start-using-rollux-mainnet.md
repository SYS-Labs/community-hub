Join the ecosystem that is securing Web3 with Bitcoin and scaling EVM for widespread adoption.


To start using the variety of apps across DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and more on Rollux you'll need a wallet with some SYS to cover transaction costs. 


New to crypto, no problem! It only takes 3 steps:

1.  Download a wallet

2.  Add Rollux to your wallet (optional)

3.  Fund your wallet with SYS


Keep reading for more detailed steps!

## Step 1 - Download a wallet
Your wallet is like your universal account â€” instead of creating new accounts on every website, just connect your wallet to use apps on Rollux. Wallets allow you to store digital assets like SYS and interact with apps.

There are a lot of different wallets available.

If you're new to Rollux, the recommended wallets from the community are:

[**Pali Wallet**](https://paliwallet.com) (Mobile (iOS, Android), and browser extension (Chrome, Firefox))  
[**Metamask**](https://metamask.io) (Mobile (iOS, Android), and browser extension (Chrome, Firefox))  


## Step 2 - Add Rollux to your wallet (optional)
Rollux is already enabled in Pali Wallet by default, so if you choose to [install and use Pali](connect-pali.md) you can skip this step! Otherwise, to add Rollux to MetaMask follow this [guide](connect-metamask.md).



## Step 3 - Fund your wallet with SYS
To try an app on Rollux you'll need SYS to pay for transaction fees. You can deposit SYS directly onto Rollux from a debit or credit card, an exchange, or from Syscoin NEVM by using a bridge.

There are three main options to get SYS into your wallet on Rollux:

**Centralized Exchange (recommended for ease-of-use)**  
You can buy SYS from exchanges that support the Rollux network, like [DigiFinex](https://digifinex.com). When you withdraw your SYS from the exchange, select Rollux as the network you are withdrawing to and provide your wallet address that begins with "0x".

There are also a lot of exchanges that support Syscoin NEVM, Rollux's Layer 1, so you get get SYS from these too! These exchanges include: [KuCoin](https://kucoin.com), [Bitmart](https://bitmart.com), [LBank](https://lbank.info), and [MEXC](https://mexc.com). We expect many of these will support direct withdrawals to Rollux soon, but until then you can use the Portal with them, which is pretty easy! After you withdraw your SYS from these exchanges to your Syscoin NEVM wallet, you can then use the [Rollux Portal](https://rollux.com/bridge) to move your SYS to Rollux.

**Bridge your SYS from Syscoin NEVM to Rollux**  
Our official bridge is called [Rollux Portal](https://rollux.com/bridge). It makes it easy to move your SYS (or other digital assets) from Syscoin NEVM to Rollux!

**By credit/debit card, Apple Pay, or other legacy payment methods**
