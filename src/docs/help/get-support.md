### We're excited you're part of the Rollux community, and happy to help!

**Before reaching out for support, please view the Help Center guides and tutorials. You can also search our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux) to see if the answer has already been given!**

Still need support? There are two dedicated support channels:

## Live Support for users 💁‍♀️

Need help right away? Head to `#🆘│live-support` in the Rollux [Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux).  
Keep in mind, sometimes this channel might be busy, or during holidays there might be fewer volunteers.

## Open a Support Ticket 🎫

If for any reason live support volunteers are unavailable at the moment, or it's just more convenient for you, feel free to open a ticket! We respond as quickly as possible.

The ticket system is available for you in `#🆘│open-ticket-support` within the Rollux [Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux).
