Rollux, the first layer 2 rollup with EVM-equivalence backed by the security of Bitcoin's network — is live on mainnet! These are exciting times, and we are just as thrilled as you are! Here are some things to be mindful of considering this phase of mainnet is Beta.

State Of Progressive Decentralization
The Arbitrum DAO system is the owner of both the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum AnyTrust chains; see “State of Progressive Decentralization” for more.

General Words Of Caution: Software Bugs
Offchain Labs’ implementation of the Arbitrum protocol has been carefully constructed, is perpetually being audited by several independent firms, and is continuously reviewed and tested following best engineering practices. That said, there remains a non-zero chance that our codebase contains some undiscovered vulnerabilities that put user funds at risk. Users should carefully factor this risk into their decision to use Arbitrum One and/or Arbitrum Nova, and in deciding how much of their value to entrust into the system. Note that Offchain Labs also sponsors a multi-million dollar bug bounty program to incentivize any party who funds such a critical bug to disclose it responsibly.

General Words of Caution: Scams
Arbitrum, like Ethereum, is permissionless; on both platforms, anybody can deploy any smart contract code they want. Users should treat interacting with contracts on Arbitrum exactly as they do with Ethereum, i.e., they should only do so if they have good reason to trust that the application is secure.
