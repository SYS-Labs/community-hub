ðŸŽˆ Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have you!

There are plenty of ways to contribute, in particular we appreciate support in the following areas:

## Code contributions

The Rollux codebase is maintained in a monorepo at [https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux). It's a [collection of packages](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux#directory-structure) all requiring different skills to maintain and evolve ranging from NodeJS and TypeScript, Solidity and EVM, Go and Geth to Docker and Kubernetes. The following are good entry points into using your coding skills to help us build Rollux:

- Reporting issues. For security issues Rollux echoes [Optimism's security policy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
- If you find an Optimism-specific bug, make sure to participate in their [Bug Bouty programme](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/).
- Fixing and responding to existing issues. You can start off with those tagged ["good first issue"](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux/contribute) which are meant as introductory issues for external contributors. If you don't see any, check back!

::: tip
Following the guidelines on [Contributing](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Rollux and Optimism's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all your interactions with the project will ensure your contributions are processed by the team.
