This Privacy Notice applies to personal information Syscoin Stichting (the “Foundation”),
collects through this website (www.rollux.com). Below are highlights of our personal
information handling practices.  

The Foundation is a foundation (nonprofit) company created under the laws of the Netherlands.
The purpose of this document is to provide you with information on the Foundation's use of your
personal data in accordance with the DIFC Law No. 1 of 2007 (as amended) and, in respect of
any EU data subjects, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (together, the "Data Protection
Legislation").  

<b>‍Your personal data.</b> ‍ By virtue of providing us with personal information on individuals
connected with you (for example directors, trustees, employees, representatives, shareholders,
investors, clients, beneficial owners or agents), you will provide us with certain personal
information which constitutes personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection
Legislation.  

We may also obtain personal data on you from other publicly accessible directories and sources.
This includes information relating to you and/or any individuals connected with you such as:
name, residential address, email address, contact details, corporate contact information,
signature, nationality, place of birth, date of birth, tax identification, credit history,
correspondence records, passport number, bank account details.

<b>‍How the Foundation may use your personal data.</b>  
‍‍The Foundation, as the data controller, may collect, store and use your personal data for purposes
including the following. The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract,
including:    
- administering or managing the Foundation; facilitating the continuation or termination of
the contractual relationship between you and the Foundation; and facilitating the transfer
of assets, and administering and facilitating any other transaction, between you and the
Foundation. The processing is necessary for compliance with applicable legal or
regulatory obligations, including:  
- undertaking due diligence including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
financing checks, including verifying identity and addresses (and, where applicable, in
relation to beneficial owners); sanctions screening and complying with applicable
sanctions and embargo legislation; complying with requests from regulatory,
governmental, tax and law enforcement authorities; surveillance and investigation
activities; carrying out audit checks, and instructing our auditors; maintaining statutory
registers; and preventing and detecting fraud. In pursuance of our legitimate interests, or
those of a third party to whom your personal data are disclosed, including:  
- complying with a legal, tax, accounting or regulatory obligation to which we or the third
party are subject; assessing and processing requests you make; investigating any
complaints, or pursuing or defending any claims, proceedings or disputes; providing you
with, and informing you about, products and services; managing our risk and operations; 
complying with audit requirements; ensuring internal compliance with our policies and
procedures; protecting the Foundation against fraud, breach of confidence or theft of
proprietary materials; seeking professional advice, including legal advice; facilitating
business asset transactions involving the Foundation or related entities; monitoring
communications to/from us (where permitted by law); and protecting the security and
integrity of our IT systems. We will only process your personal data in pursuance of our
legitimate interests where we have considered that the processing is necessary and, on
balance, our legitimate interests are not overridden by your legitimate interests, rights or
freedoms.


<b>Sharing your personal data</b>  
We may share your personal data with our affiliates and delegates. In certain circumstances we
may be legally obliged to share your personal data and other financial information with respect
to your interest in the Foundation with relevant regulatory authorities. They, in turn, may
exchange this information with foreign authorities, including tax authorities and other applicable
regulatory authorities. In exceptional circumstances, we will share your Personal Data with
regulatory, prosecuting and other governmental agencies or departments, and parties to litigation
(whether pending or threatened) in any country or territory.  

We will disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent if we receive an order,
subpoena, warrant or other legal requirement issued by a court, tribunal, regulator or other
person with jurisdiction to compel disclosure of your personal information.  

The Foundation’s affiliates and delegates may process your personal data on the Foundation's
behalf, including with our service providers, banks, accountants, auditors and lawyers which may
be data controllers in their own right. The Foundation's services providers are generally
processors acting on the instructions of the Foundation. Additionally, a service provider may use
your personal data where this is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which it is
directly subject. The service provider, in respect of this specific use of personal data, may be
deemed to be acting as a data controller.  

<b>Sending your personal data internationally</b>  
‍Due to the international nature of our business, your personal data may be transferred to
jurisdictions that do not offer equivalent protection of personal data as under the Data Protection
Legislation. In such cases, we will process personal data or procure that it be processed in
accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.  

<b>‍Retention and deletion of your personal data</b>  
‍We will keep your personal data for as long as it is required by us. For example, we may require
it for our legitimate business purposes, to perform our contractual obligations, or where law or
regulation obliges us to. Some personal data will be retained after your relationship with us ends.
We expect to delete your personal data (at the latest) once there is no longer any legal or
regulatory requirement or legitimate business purpose for retaining your personal data.  

<b>Automated decision-making</b>  
We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or otherwise significantly
affecting you, based solely on automated processing of your personal data, unless we have 
considered the proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that it meets the
applicable requirements under the Data Protection Legislation.  

<b>Links to Third-Party Websites and Social Network Plug-Ins.</b>  
You may be able to access third-party websites through links available on our websites. You may
also connect to social networks. These links are provided for your convenience. We do not have
any control over those third-party websites and we do not provide any guarantee that the privacy
practices of the hosts of those websites meet our standards. Your use of such third-party websites
is at your own risk and will be governed by the privacy policies of those websites and not by this
Privacy Notice. Do not transmit personal information using those websites without reading the
