## <p><center><b>COMMUNITY NOTICE</b></center></p>  
Hi Rolluxer! Please read this entire notice carefully. It contains important legal information about Rollux Mainnet (the Syscoin layer 2 scaling protocol we help steward), SYS Labs Holdings Ltd (SYSLABS) and Syscoin Stichting (the “Foundation”), collectively referred to as "us" or "we", and other important things.
‍

This notice has two main components:

1. A legal disclaimer.  Basically, it says that SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation do not guarantee, and will not be liable for, its public contributions or those of the broader community.

‍2. A list of key points for you to be aware of.  This list is intended to help you make informed decisions about your interactions with Rollux, SYS Labs, and Syscoin Foundation.

Again, please read this entire notice carefully.

ROLLUX, SYS LABS, AND SYSCOIN FOUNDATION

Rollux is (an ethos, a movement, and) a public, internet-based blockchain computing platform. It is configured to inherit permissionless-ness, decentralization, and security attributes from another blockchain computing platform, Syscoin. Because of this configuration, Rollux is referred to as a “Layer 2” blockchain computing platform.

Rollux and the suite of open source code, tooling, infrastructure, and governance systems underlying it are composed of many different and evolving components, which are contributed, used, and supported by a wide variety of participants. These participants, ranging from developers to node operators, creators to token holders, and builders to web3 enthusiasts and beyond, comprise the Rollux community. Rollux grows and changes through the efforts of the community.

SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation contribute to, and steward, the Rollux community. Among other things, SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation contribute to the continuing development and maintenance of Rollux by making, maintaining, facilitating, publicizing or otherwise working on or encouraging:

Community education and involvement.
Procedural and administrative support.
Allocations and disbursements of community grants and retroactive public goods funding. 
Rollux software, smart contracts, APIs, and utilities, including Rollux Portal and other front ends that interact with Rollux smart contracts.
Syscoin Foundation contributes data processing for the network and operating one or more nodes. 
Written, video, and other content on our website, various social media platforms and elsewhere.
Generally being a resource to the community in a variety of other ways. 
All of the above software, content and activities are referred to in this notice as our “Software, Content, and Activities.” Sometimes we are paid in connection with our Software, Content, and Activities. Other times we are not.
‍

‍LEGAL DISCLAIMER

‍We work in the open, guided by an open source ethos, with products on the leading edge of what we believe to be a technological revolution in decentralized computation. This is a fundamentally experimental enterprise. Accordingly, unless we specify otherwise in writing to you, please keep the following terms in mind.

SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation make no representation, warranty, guarantee, or undertaking regarding Rollux or any of our Software, Content, and Activities, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of compliance, accuracy, reliability, validity, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quality, availability, durability, and noninfringement, or as to any of it being uninterrupted, error free, free of harmful components, or secure. 

SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation are not liable for, or in connection with, any actions, proceedings, claims, damages, expenses or other liabilities, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, related to or in connection with Rollux, our Software, Content, and Activities, or the use or dealings in or with any of them or in reliance thereon.
‍

‍OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

When interacting with Rollux, us, or our Software, Content, and Activities, please keep the following points in mind.

We do not control Rollux.  Rollux is a Syscoin Layer 2, meaning that the canonical state of its blockchain can, at any time, be derived (by anyone) from information embedded in existing blocks on the Syscoin blockchain. We do not control Syscoin, and you should not rely on us (or any other party) to control Rollux. For the above reasons and others we do not, and cannot, do so.  
Rollux is a work in progress.  Rollux is built on new and evolving technology. Its codebase has been audited, but it still may contain unknown bugs. In addition, the security of Rollux is currently dependent on a multisignature wallet, managed by several anonymous individuals, which can be used to maliciously upgrade core Rollux smart contracts without upgrade delays or the approval by SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation. This introduces various risks, including the loss of some or all of the assets held within the system.
Do your own research before using or engaging with Rollux.  Be careful and always do your own due diligence before engaging with any component of Rollux, regardless of who built or implemented it. Read widely. Stay on top of updates and developments. Be curious. Don’t leave any stone unturned, and don’t assume that something is correct or will function a certain way without verifying.
When you use Rollux, it is at your own risk.  This includes risks specific to Rollux (such as those described above) and the risks inherent in using any cryptographic or blockchain-based system (such as wallet and private key management, variable transaction costs and speeds, technological vulnerabilities, cryptographic attack vectors, and risks relating to digital assets). You should not use Rollux unless you have sufficient knowledge to understand and accept all the risks.
… this includes the risk of loss of your wallet private keys and seed phrases.  You are solely responsible for securing the wallet private keys and seed phrases you use to store and transfer assets on Rollux. It is your responsibility to avoid losing them or sharing them with anyone else. Once lost, there may be nothing that can be done to recover access to your wallet or to otherwise provide you with recourse.
We are not, do not speak for, and cannot bind, the Rollux community.  Rollux is a collection of independent contributors to the Rollux project. SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation are separate, independent entities from the Rollux community. While we currently do work to steward the Rollux community and its mission, we do not speak for it, and cannot contractually bind it in any manner. Unless we say otherwise in writing, the individual conduct of participants in the Rollux community are not covered, or endorsed by, SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation in any way.  
We do not endorse third parties or third party information.  Any time we link to, quote or otherwise reference a third party or reproduce or incorporate their information, content or material, it is solely for informational purposes. You should not assume that we have verified the accuracy of, or endorse in any way, such information, content or materials. 
You are responsible for your own compliance.  We attempt to comply with applicable laws, rules and contractual obligations with respect to all of our Software, Content, and Activities. However, that landscape is constantly changing and differs jurisdiction by jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to conduct your own inquiry to ensure that your activity on Rollux complies with all applicable laws, rules, and contractual obligations.
When we talk about future ideas or prospects, we are expressing our vision and hopes, and there is no commitment or guarantee that it will come true, that we will implement any of it, or that it will work.  The world changes quickly and technology at an even faster pace. We have no idea how things will turn out and our aspirations and predictions may be unreliable. Look carefully at the date of things because after that date, things might have changed (a lot).
You should not rely on us for any specific future work relating to Rollux.  SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation aim to create the technical and governance foundations that allow us to decentralize our roles over time. We happily contribute to the Rollux community today, but we are also proud to pursue a world where this community does not need us in order for it to continue to thrive tomorrow. That’s the whole point of a public, open source, blockchain-based system with decentralized governance.
While the above is not an exhaustive list of potentially relevant considerations, we hope you find it, and the other content of this notice, helpful. Please save a copy of this notice for your records. It may be modified from time to time – at which point we’ll notify you by updating the date at the bottom of this page. Finally, if you are a member of the Rollux and/or Optimism community and believe some or all of the information in this notice will be helpful to present to your users, clients, or friends, please fork it!
