## Where should I start?

If you're brand new to Rollux, we recommend checking out our [guide to deploying a basic contract](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started)
It'll get you familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Rollux is based on Optimism Bedrock which makes it [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306). That means deploying a contract to Rollux is 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum, plus all your familiar Ethereum tools can work with Rollux.

If you're a bit more familiar with Rollux on Syscoin, you can walk through the various [tutorials](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux-tutorial).
They'll help you get a headstart building your first Rollux project.


## Guides

These guides provide integration guidelines for specific topics.
They are intended as one stop shops, and should have all the relevant information you need for completing a specific type of integration, from network information and tutorials to tips and tricks.

We're aiming to maintain guides for many of the common interactions that developers might have with Rollux.
For example, we have guides for adding Rollux support to a [wallet](./wallet-dev.md) or a [CEX](./cex-dev.md).
We also have guides for getting your [token onto the standard bridge](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux-tutorial/tree/main/standard-bridge-standard-token) or even [writing your own custom bridge](./bridge-dev.md).

Take a look at the list on the left for a complete list of the guides we've created so far.
