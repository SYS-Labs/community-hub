# TODO 

Optimism's Community Hub was used as a base for this documentation.

All new content should be added as a superset of the original MDs whenever possible, with the optimism-specific content to be removed later.

Rely on design/aesthetics/format as-is for now.

### Todo

- [ ] Add usage tutorial/rpcs 
- [ ] Consistent Formatting  
- [ ] Adapt /Dev Docs/ thoroughly
- [ ] META: Link to Syscoin docs whenever appropriate  
- [ ] Add Remix examples to guides linking to deployed repo

- [ ] docs/guides/bridge-dev.md: Add correct URLs for Rollux Portal and Rollux token list repository (fork ethereum-optimism.github.io repo???)
- [ ] biz > README.md: Create builder form (Google Forms?) that sends entries to bizdev.
- [ ] Replace all Alchemy references with Ankr
- [ ] useful-tools/oracles.md: Provide SupraOracles price feed contract addr on Rollux Tanenbaum
